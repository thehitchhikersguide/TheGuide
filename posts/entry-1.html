    <h1>Entry 2 — Why You Can’t Focus (According to a Giant Owl)</h1>
    <p class="note">Filed under: Evolution, cosmic misadventure, and the tragedies of human attention</p>
</header>

<p>
In the humble forests of Earth’s prehistoric past, there once lived an owl named <strong>Tyto</strong>. 
Tyto was, strictly speaking, not the kind of owl you’d want to meet on a quiet walk through the woods 
because Tyto was roughly the size of your disappointment in humanity’s attention span—immense.
</p>

<p>
Owls, as a rule, don’t bother themselves with existential questions. They focus. They sit. They stare. 
They wait. They swoop. Simple. Efficient. Deadly.  
Meanwhile, humans invented notifications, multitasking, and the brilliant idea of trying to read a book 
while checking three social media apps and wondering what that one ex from 2014 is doing right now.
</p>

<h2>The Evolutionary Problem</h2>
<p>
For millions of years, nature rewarded creatures that could hold one very specific thought at a time, 
usually along the lines of: <em>“Don’t die.”</em>  
Tyto, for example, could sit in silence for hours, unblinking, waiting for a mouse to reveal its 
location by sneezing, thinking, or daring to be alive.
</p>

<p>
Humans, on the other hand, evolved in groups, gossiping around fires, retelling stories, and constantly 
scanning the savannah for lions, snakes, food, rivals, dramatic relationship developments, or 
opportunities to invent new problems. Focus wasn’t our strength—survival by chaos was.
</p>

<h2>The Modern Tragedy</h2>
<p>
The average adult now has an attention span shorter than a distracted goldfish, which is impressive 
because goldfish do not have access to TikTok. Your brain, once tuned to detect predators, now fires 
the same emergency circuits for things like unread emails or someone typing “k” instead of “ok.”
</p>

<p>
If Tyto were alive today, he would observe humans with the same expression he used when 
staring at very stupid mice. Except this time, the mice have smartphones.
</p>

<h2>The Lesson</h2>
<p>
So what does all this mean? It means your inability to focus is not a moral failing—it’s an 
evolutionary inheritance combined with a technologically weaponized attention economy.  
But—unlike mice—you can choose to change it.
</p>

<p>
Sit. Breathe. Read slowly. Turn off notifications. Become a little more like Tyto.  
But maybe don’t swoop on anyone. Modern society frowns on that.
