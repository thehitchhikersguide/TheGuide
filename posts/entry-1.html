<h1>Entry 1</h1>
<h2>The Surprisingly Inconvenient Nature of Learning Things</h2>

<p>
    According to most books, learning is supposed to be a noble and inspiring activity.
    According to the universe, however, it is more like trying to assemble flat-pack furniture 
    using instructions written by a raccoon who has never seen a hex key.
</p>

<p>
    Today's lesson came from a book insisting that “small habits can change your life,”
    which sounds very convincing but fails to mention that the *small habits* in question 
    include things like remembering where you put the book in the first place.
</p>

<p>
    Still, the process was enlightening. Mostly because I read it near a window, and sunlight 
    was involved. But also because each chapter quietly reminded me that humans, for all 
    their ambition, routinely forget why they walked into a room.
</p>

<p class="note">
    Note: if the universe ever offers you a shortcut to self-improvement, it is either a trap, 
    a pyramid scheme, or both.
